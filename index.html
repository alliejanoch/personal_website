			    	<h5> About Me </h5>
				    I am an entrepreneur and programmer interested in technologies that bring people together, and make life easier and more enjoyable. Most recently I worked on computer vision and machine learning algorithms for <a href="https://www.iqengines.com/">IQEngines</a>, a company developing software to help people organize and search their photos by understanding what is in actual the pixels. IQEngines was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/23/yahoo-acquires-image-recognition-startup-iq-engines/">acquired by Yahoo in August 2013</a>, and since then, I have been working for Yahoo, integrating our software into Flickr and continuing to make improvements. 
				    <br>
				    <h5> Background </h5>
				    I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from University of Maryland in 2009. I moved out to California in 2010 to pursue a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, but choose to leave the program early (with a Masters) in pursuit of more entrepreneurial goals.  
				    <br><br>
				    I have been coding since I was 15 and had the opportunity to take a high school class on Visual Basic (which I have never used again!). I was encouraged to take the class by father, who is also a software engineer. In fact, largely due to his influence, I have known since before I knew how to program that I was a going to be a computer scientist. At age 8 I asked my parents to get our first family computer. And at age 12, I wrote in my 6th grade year book that my future career would be as a "software engineer." (I was actually shocked to see this when I looked through the book 8 years later.) 
				    <br>
				    <h5> Women in CS </h5>
					Perhaps because I have known from such a young age what I wanted to do, I have not let the lack of female programmers deter me. Unfortunately, most women are not so lucky. Not everyone has a parent encouraging them to learn about programming. I am passionate about getting women and girls involved in computer science, and mentored a great group of girls in the <a href="http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/">Technovation Challenge</a> in 2013. If you have a daughter in high school or are a female programmer looking for mentoring opportunities, I recommend you check out the program!
